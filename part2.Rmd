RNAseq analysis methods
Part 2
1.	Open R (I use R studio, you can also use the command line) 
2.	Install edgeR. 


```{r}
source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite("edgeR")
```

3.	Load the edgeR package. We will use edgeR to identify significantly differentially expressed genes between our two groups based on counts of gene expression for each gene. 

```{r}
library(edgeR)
```
