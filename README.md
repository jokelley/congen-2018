Our recently published paper with RNAseq and SNPs called from RNAseq data (And a few additional fun things to check out):

[Concordant changes in gene expression and nucleotides underlie independent adaptation to hydrogen-sulfide-rich environments](https://academic.oup.com/gbe/advance-article/doi/10.1093/gbe/evy198/5095659?guestAccessKey=ea32802c-568b-4ef3-b7a4-5c1b9ca0d3ac)
Genome Biology and Evolution


The paper I mentioned about different RNA preservation methods (be sure to check out the comments below) [RNAlater and flash freezing storage methods nonrandomly influence observed gene expression in RNAseq experiments](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/07/29/379834)
